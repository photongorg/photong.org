    <h1>A Return to Nanjing, After Loss</h1>
    <p>A Photo Essay</p>

    <div class="text">
      <p>On January 22, 2023, Emma and I boarded a flight to China. It was my first trip back since the pandemic began. I carried my compact digital camera and decided to shoot only in black and white in Nanjing, my childhood home.</p>

      <p>My mother passed away a month earlier during the devastating surge that began in December 2022 after the abrupt end of zero-COVID restrictions. Within weeks, nearly everyone I knew in China has been infected; countless elders, including my mother, did not survive. My father had died two years before. Travel bans and border closures meant I could not be there at either of their bedsides. I never got to say goodbye. Now, as one of the first “foreigners” to re-enter China after the lockdown, I was returning not to reunite, but to reckon with absence.</p>

      <p>My mother developed a persistent fever on November 25, 2022. I was half a world away at a Thanksgiving gathering that evening, anxiously watching through a video camera installed in her bedroom. She died two weeks later in the hospital.</p>

      Among them, a local England newspaper from 1980: my father, second from the left, attending an international cultural event at Cranfield Institute of Technology, where he spent two years as a visiting scholar. 
      A handwritten will in an old envelope. 
      Airline napkins carefully saved from their visits to Texas, where their son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren lived. Those visits were among the happiest moments in their lives.

      Both my parents were professors. I grew up on the university campus, knowing every nook and cranny of it. Once vibrant, now it felt eerily frozen, emptied of life.
